<p> The scope 2 counterexample for removeOkay and removeAllOkay is the same:</p>

<p> &nbsp; <img align=absmiddle src="bug1.png"> -&gt; <img align=absmiddle src="bug2.png"></p>

<p>
    In the pre state, Dir0 is the root, and Dir1 is the directory to be removed.
    So far so good. In the post state, indeed there is no longer a <b><tt>parent</tt></b>
    relationship between Dir0 and Dir1. However, Dir1 is chosen as the new root!
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> Why can this happen? First, let's note that both remove and removeAll predicates
    cause the rows of the parent relation in the post-state to be a
    subset of the rows in the pre-state. And we know the
    <b><tt>FileSystem</tt></b> appended facts "<b><tt>live in
    root.*contents</tt></b>" constrains the root of the file system
    to be the root of the contents relation. So if the post-state has
    a non-empty <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation, it will have the
    same root as the pre-state. However if delete function causes the
    post-state to have an empty contents relation, then the root is
    free to change arbitrarily, to any directory available.  Bet you
    didn't see that coming.  Good thing we wrote a model!

<p> We can amend our delete functions to stipulate that the root stays the same.
    The amended delete functions look as follows:

<pre><b>pred remove [fs, fs': FileSystem, x: FSObject] {
  x in (fs.live - fs.root)
  fs'.root = fs.root
  fs'.parent = fs.parent - x->(x.(fs.parent))
}</b></pre>

and

<pre><b>pred removeAll [fs, fs': FileSystem, x: FSObject] {
  x in (fs.live - fs.root)
  fs'.root = fs.root
  let subtree = x.*(fs.contents) |
      fs'.parent = fs.parent - subtree->(subtree.(fs.parent))
}</b></pre>

<p> When we check the assertions up to a scope of 5, Alloy finds no
    counterexamples.  We can be fairly certain that our predicates work
    as intended.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> As one final sanity check, let's verify that
    <b><tt>remove</tt></b> and <b><tt>removeAll</tt></b> are
    equivalent when the deleted object is a file:

<pre><b>removeAllSame: check {
  all fs, fs1, fs2: FileSystem, f: File |
    remove[fs, fs1, f] && removeAll[fs, fs2, f] => fs1.live = fs2.live
} for 5</b></pre>

<p> Alloy finds no counterexamples, thus further reassuring us that
    the remove predicates functions were written correctly and that the system we
    are modeling does not have errors.  The final version of the model
    is in the upper righthand frame.
