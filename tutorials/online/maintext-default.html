<h1>Tutorial for Alloy Analyzer 4.0</h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p> <a href="https://alloytools.org/"
    target="new"><i>Alloy</i></a> is a lightweight modelling language
    for software design. It is amenable to a fully automatic analysis,
    using the Alloy Analyzer, and provides a visualizer for making
    sense of solutions and counterexamples it finds.

<p> This introduction to <i>Alloy</i> includes:
<ul>
<li> a <b>tutorial</b> for writing declarative models in <i>Alloy</i> </li>
<li> a <b>walkthrough</b> of the <i>Alloy</i> interface and visualizer </li>
<li> tips and techniques to help you with the <b>modeling process</b> </li>
<li> two thoroughly explained <b>sample models</b> which are developed
     as running examples </li>
</ul>

<p> This tutorial does not:
<ul>
<li> provide an <b>exhaustive list</b> of <i>Alloy</i> commands,
     although many are described in sidenotes;
<li> focus on the <b>technical semantics</b> of <i>Alloy</i>, although
     we do touch upon it in several sidenotes.  Rather, we focus on
     getting you to a point where you can read, write, and analyze
     reasonably advanced models;
<li> give a lengthy description of the <b>background philosophy</b>
     behind modeling and declarative modeling.  The philosophy chapter gives a
     summary of these issues, but the focus of this tutorial is to
     teach <i>Alloy</i> not convincing you to use it.
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for using this tutorial</h2>

<p> The main text of the tutorial will appear in this frame of the
    window.  We will use running sample models, displayed in the top-right frame.
    Relevant side notes will be loaded in the bottom-right frame.
    Sidenotes provide supplemental
    information and can be skipped without impeding your
    understanding of the current model.

<h2>The Chapters (start here)</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="frame-FS-0.html" target="_top">Chapter 0</a>, gives background for
     declarative modeling, compares Alloy to its alternatives, and
     further introduces the tutorial.<br><br>

<li> <a href="frame-FS-1.html" target="_top">Chapter 1</a> follows the development and
     analysis of a simple <i>Alloy</i> model of a file system, This
     chapter includes an <a href="frame-FS-2.html" target="_top">
     <i>Alloy</i> interface walkthrough</a>.
     This will also introduce you to Alloy's improved solution visualizer.<br><br>

<li> <a href="frame-RC-1.html" target="_top">Chapter 2</a> examines a more advanced
     <i>Alloy</i> model which solves the famous <a
     href="sidenote-RC-puzzle.html" target="sidenote"> River
     Crossing</a> planning problem, using the
     <b><tt>util/ordering</b></tt> module for modeling ordered state.
</ul>

<p> <i>Alloy</i> was developed at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/"
    target="new"> MIT</a> by the <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/"
    target="new"> Software Design Group</a> under the guidance of <a
    href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/people/dnj.html" target="new"> Daniel
    Jackson</a>.  This research was funded by grant <i>0086154</i>
    from the <a href="http://www.itr.nsf.gov/" target="new"> ITR</a>
    program of the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target="new">
    National Science Foundation</a>, by a grant from <a
    href="http://www.nasa.gov/"target="new">NASA</a>, and by an
    endowment from Doug and Pat Ross.

<p> This tutorial was originally written by Rob Seater and Greg Dennis. It has since been
    updated to match the new Alloy4 syntax by Daniel Le Berre and Felix Chang.
