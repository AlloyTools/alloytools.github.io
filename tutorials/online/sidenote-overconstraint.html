    <h2>Overconstraint - the bane of declarative modeling</h2>

<p> Overconstraint means that you have accidentally constrained your
system to eliminate possibilities which you intended to allow.</p>

<p> In the extreme, it eliminate all examples.  This is particularly
    dangerous, since it means that there are no counterexamples to
    your other assertions because there are no examples at all, not
    because they are actually true.  You can use the
    <a href="sidenote-format-run.html" ><b><tt>run</b></tt> command
    to help spot overconstraint</a>.</p>

<p> In more subtle cases, it may mask examples which would revealed
    faults or safety concerns.  Currently, there isn't tool support
    for this, and most modelers find it to be the main time-cost when
    debugging a model.</p>

<p> Alloy Analyzer can be configured to use <i>unsat core extraction</i>
    technology to provide a tool which not only helps identify
    overconstraints, but also narrows down where you need to look for
    the source of overconstraints you are aware of.</p>

<p> The flip side of overconstraint is <a href="sidenote-underconstraint.html" > underconstraint</a>,
    in which you allow possibilities which you
    had meant to disallow.  It is a much less serious problem, and
    much easier to identify.</p>
