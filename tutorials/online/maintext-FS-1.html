<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p> Our first Alloy model is located in the upper-righthand frame. It
    is a short model of a file system.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> Alloy models can contain comments by beginning a line with
    the character
    sequence "<b><tt>//</b></tt>".
</p>

<i><pre>
  // A file system object in the file system
</pre></i>

<p> There are actually three different <a
    href="sidenote-format-comments.html" target="sidenote"> formats
    for writing <i>comments</i></a> in Alloy, all reminiscent of other
    programming languages.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> After the comment, comes our first <a
    href="sidenote-format-sig.html" target="sidenote"> signature</a>
    declaration, "<b><tt>sig FSObject</b></tt>".  It defines a set
    named <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>, representing the set of all
    <i>file system objects</i> (both directories and files) in the
    file system.
</p>

<b><pre>
  sig FSObject {
    parent: lone Dir
  }
</pre></b>

<p> Following the signature declaration is its body, surrounded by
    curly braces.  Here we can define relations that have this
    signature as their domain.  Relations defined here behave like
    fields of an object in the <a href="sidenote-OO-paradigm.html"
    target="sidenote"> OO paradigm</a>.
</p>

<p> For instance, in the <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt> signature body, we
    define a relation called <b><tt>parent</b></tt> which relates
    <b><tt>FSObjects</b></tt> to <b><tt>Dirs</b></tt> (directories).
    Just think of this as saying that each file system object has a
    <b><tt>parent</b></tt> field which is a <b><tt>Dir</b></tt>.  The
    keyword <b><tt>lone</b></tt> simply indicates that there are 0
    or 1 <b><tt>parent</b></tt> dir for each
    <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>.  That is, not every file system object
    has a parent.
</p>

<p> You can read more about <a href="sidenote-OO-paradigm.html"
    target="sidenote"> how you can read Alloy as if it were an Object
    Oriented language</a>, like Java or C++.  However, while the OO
    metaphore is useful, a deeper (but still intuitive) <a
    href="sidenote-levels-of-understanding.html" target="sidenote">set
    theoretic understanding</a> will eventually be required, an
    interested readers may like to know how Alloy really works <a
    href="sidenote-relations-everywhere.html" target="sidenote">
    behind the scenes</a>.
</p>

<p> The signatures <b><tt>Dir</tt></b> and <b><tt>Root</tt></b> are
    defined later in the model; the order in which we define the
    signatures is irrelevant.  In fact, more generally, the order of
    paragraphs (statements) in an Alloy model does not affect its
    meaning.  This is in the spirit of being <a
    href="sidenote-operational-declarative.html" target="sidenote">
    declarative rather than imperative </a> -- all the statements and
    constraints must hold, but there is no notion of an order or
    sequence to them.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> The signatures <b><tt>Dir</b></tt> and <b><tt>File</b></tt>
    represent the directories and files in the file system:
</p>

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// A directory in the file system</i><b>
  sig Dir extends FSObject {
    contents: set FSObject
  }
</pre></b>
and later,
<b><pre>
  </b><i>// A file in the file system</i><b>
  sig File extends FSObject { }
</pre></b>

<p> Both declarations end in "<b><tt>extends FSObject</b></tt>",
    indicating that files and directories are subtypes of file system
    objects.  This means two things: (1) the set of all
    <b><tt>File</b></tt>s is a subset of the set of all
    <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>s, and (2) <b><tt>File</tt></b>s are
    disjoint from other subtypes of <b><tt>FSObject</tt></b> (ie it is
    disjoint from <b><tt>Dir</tt></b>).  Anything we can do to a
    <b><tt>FSObject</tt></b> can also be done to a
    <b><tt>File</tt></b> or a <b><tt>Dir</tt></b>.
</p>

<p> You may wish to read about other <a
    href="sidenote-format-sig.html" target="sidenote"> options for
    signatures</a>.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> It is not enough to simply define directories and files as we did
    above.  We also need to add some basic sanity constraints to make
    sure they behave the way we intuitively expect.  For example,
    the offhand <tt><b>parent</b></tt> and
    <b><tt>contents</b></tt> fields need not bear any particular
    relation to one another.  Of course, when we added those fields we
    had a very specific constraint in mind: a directory is the parent
    of its contents.  So, we need to write the following constraint to
    limit the behaviour of our model:
</p>

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// A directory is the parent of its contents</i><b>
  fact {
     all d: Dir, o: d.contents | o.parent = d
  }
</pre></b>

<p> In words: "Given any directory <b><tt>d</b></tt> and any
    (<b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>) <b><tt>o</b></tt> in
    <b><tt>d</b></tt>'s contents, <b><tt>d</b></tt> must be the parent
    of <b><tt>o</b></tt>.".  You may wish to look over some <a
    href="sidenote-alternative-defineContents.html" target="sidenote">
    equivalent ways of writing this fact</a>.
</p>

<p> Had we omitted this fact, then we could have gotten situations
like this:
</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="crazy-fs1.png" BORDER=0>

<p> There are many <tt>parent</tt> relationships among the objects,
but no <tt>contents</tt> relationships!</p>

<p> Upon seeing such an absurd example, we would have realized that we
    forgot a sanity constraint or two.  We will describe the process
    of debugging your model later; for now, let's keep looking at how
    to write one in the first place. </p>

<p> Alloy supports several
    <a href="sidenote-quantifiers.html" target="sidenote">
    quantifiers</a> including the standard
    <i>universal</i> ("for all...") and <i>existential</i> ("there
    exists...") quantifiers.
</p>

<p> A <a href="sidenote-format-fact.html" target="sidenote">
    <b><tt>fact</b></tt> statement</a> in Alloy puts an explicit
    constraint (or list of constraints) on the model.  When Alloy
    searches for examples, it discards any which violate any fact.
    Thus, if the fact is trivially false, then you will simply get no
    examples of file systems (but won't be told that the model is
    inconsistent).  Later we will see the 'run' command which helps
    make sure that you have neither <a
    href="sidenote-overconstraint.html" target="sidenote">
    overconstrained</a> the model nor <a
    href="sidenote-underconstraint.html" target="sidenote">
    underconstrained</a> it.
</p>

<p> In some sense, facts are "always on"; all facts automatically
    always apply.  Later, we will see <a
    href="sidenote-format-functions.html" target="sidenote">
    functions</a> and <a href="sidenote-format-pred.html"
    target="sidenote"> predicates</a> , which can serve as 'optional
    facts', allowing you to say things like "if constraint <i>A</i>
    holds then constraint <i>B</i> must hold.".
</p>

<p> Here we see the '<b><tt>.</tt></b>' operator used for the first
    time. Technically, the '<b><tt>.</tt></b>' operator is "<a
    href="sidenote-relational-join.html" target="sidenote">relation
    composition</a>" (relational join), but due to some clever
    definitions of Alloy syntax it also serves to access the fields of
    a signature.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> By declaring the signatures <tt><b>Dir</b></tt> and
    <b><tt>File</tt></b> to be extend <tt><b>FSObject</b></tt>, we
    ensured that no <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt> is both a
    <b><tt>File</b></tt> and a <b><tt>Dir</b></tt>.  However, we
    have not excluded the possibility of some <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>
    being <i>neither</i>.  The following fact does so:
</p>

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// All file system objects are either files or directories</i><b>
  fact {
    File + Dir = FSObject
  }
</pre></b>

<p> Another way to enforce that constraint would be to mark
    <b><tt>FSObject</tt></b> as <b><tt>abstract</tt></b>, by writing
    </p>

<pre><b>
abstract sig FSObject {...}
</b></pre>

<p> An abstract
    signature only contains atoms which are also contained in one of
    its extending signatures.  Exception: if there are <i>no</i>
    extending signatures, then the abstract keyword is ignored.</p>

<p> The "<tt><b>+</b></tt>" indicates set union.  Thus this fact reads
    "the union of all files and all directories is the same thing as
    set of all file system objects".  In other words,
    "<b><tt>File</b></tt> and <b><tt>Dir</b></tt> partition
    <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>"; there is no <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>
    which is neither a <b><tt>File</b></tt> nor a
    <b><tt>Dir</b></tt>ectory.  Alloy supports other standard <a
    href="sidenote-set-ops.html" target="sidenote"> set operations</a>
    (such as intersection and difference).
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> We still need to address the root directory of the file system.
    We do so by creating a new signature, <tt><b>Root</b></tt>, which
    extends <b><tt>Dir</tt></b>.  Since it is marked
    <tt><b>one</b></tt>, there will always be exactly one instance of
    it.  In the "appended fact" (in braces after the signature body),
    we constrain the root to have no parent.
</p>

<pre>
  <i>// There exists a root</i>
  <b>one sig Root extends Dir { } { no parent }</b>
</pre></b>

<p> Of course, we could have avoided using the <a
    href="sidenote-multiplicity.html" target="sidenote">
    <b><tt>one</tt></b> keyword</a> and the <a
    href="sidenote-format-appended-fact.html" target="sidenote">
    appended fact syntax</a> by writing appropriate additional facts
    to constrain the model.  There are a couple of <a
    href="sidenote-alternative-static-appended.html"
    target="sidenote"> alternatives to using <b><tt>one</b></tt>
    and and appended fact</a>, although they are not as concise.

<hr WIDTH="50%">
</p>


<p> We will now add our last "sanity" constraint, which makes sure
    that the file system is connected.  After doing that, we will be
    ready to run the Alloy analyzer and check some assertions about
    the model.
</p>

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// File system is connected</i><b>
  fact {
    FSObject in Root.*contents
  }
</pre></b>

<p> In Alloy, <A href="sidenote-set-ops.html" target="sidenote">
    <tt><b>in</b></tt></a> can be read as "<i>subset of</i>" (among
    other things).  The operator "<b><tt>*</b></tt>" denotes <a
    href="sidenote-rtc.html" target="sidenote"> reflexive transitive
    closure</a>.  Thus, this fact says that the set of all file system
    objects is a subset of everything reachable from the
    <tt><b>Root</b></tt> by following the <tt><b>contents</b></tt>
    relation zero or more times.
</p>

<p> Note that it is important that we use the <i>reflexive</i>
    transitive closure, since Root doesn't contain itself directly or
    indirectly but is part of the file system.
</p>

<p> Had we omitted this fact, we would get erroneous file systems such
    as this one:
</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="crazy-fs1.png" BORDER=0>  </p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> So far, we have described the basic structure of a file system
    using <b><tt>sig</b></tt> declarations and have added some simple
    sanity constraints using <b><tt>fact</b></tt> statements.  Now we
    are ready to reap the fruits of our labor by checking some
    properties of our model.  We will write <a
    href="sidenote-format-assert.html" target="sidenote">
    <b><tt>assert</b></tt> statements</a> in a manner very similar to
    how we wrote <b><tt>fact</b></tt> statements, and then use the
    <b><tt>check</b></tt> command to tell Alloy to automatically search
    for counter examples to our assertions.
</p>

<p> A <b><tt>fact</b></tt> <i>forces</i> something to be true of the
    model.  An <b><tt>assert</b></tt> claims that something must be
    true due to the behaviour of the model.
</p>

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// The contents path is acyclic</i><b>
  assert acyclic {
    no d: Dir | d in d.^contents
  }
</pre></b>

<p> There is no directory which contains itself (directly or
    indirectly).  That is, the containment relation among directories
    has no cycles.  We express this constraint in Alloy using
    (non-reflective) <a href="sidenote-nrtc.html" target="sidenote">
    transitive closure</a>, denoted "<b><tt>^</b></tt>".
</p>

<p> Note that we do not want to use <i>reflexive</i> transitive
    closure (like we did before) -- if you follow the contents
    relation zero times you get back the same directory, making the
    assertion trivially false!
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> Next we <a href="sidenote-format-check.html" target="sidenote">
    check</a> our assertion by searching for counterexamples (and
    hopefully finding none).  We have to choose a finite scope for
    Alloy to search within, so we choose <b><tt>5</tt></b>.  That is,
    Alloy will examine all file systems with up to 5
    <b><tt>FSObject</tt></b>s, and try to find one that violates the
    <b><tt>acyclic</b></tt> assertion.  In general, saying "<b><tt>for
    5</tt></b>", means that Alloy will examine all examples whose top
    level signatures (those that don't <b><tt>extend</tt></b> other
    signatures) have up to 5 instances. You can also say "<b><tt>for
    exactly 5</tt></b>" if you don't want to examine scopes smaller
    than 5.
</p>

<b><pre>
  check acyclic for 5
</pre></b>

<p> When a <bb><t>check</b></tt> statement is executed, there are two
    possible results (the exact message may vary depending on your
    version of Alloy):
</p>
<ul>
<li> "<tt><i>no solution found</i></tt>", meaning that there are no
     counterexamples to the assertion for the specified scope or
     smaller.  Alloy makes no guarantee about the property holding for
     larger scopes, but there is evidence that most errors that can be
     caught by models can be caught by examining only a small scope.
     This is the so-called 'small scope hypothesis'.
<li> "<tt><i>solution found</i></tt>", meaning that Alloy has found a
     counterexample.  You can then visualize that example to try to
     understand why it occurred.  Alloy does not guarantee that it
     will return the smallest counterexample that exists, so you may
     wish to try running the same <b><tt>check</b></tt> command on
     smaller scopes to bring down the size for the solution before
     visualizing it.
</ul>

<p> In the next lesson, the Alloy walkthrough, you will get a chance
    to try running check statements yourself and visualizing
    counterexamples.  For now, trust us that no counterexamples were
    found.  In fact, it holds for any scope, but Alloy only guarantees
    that it holds for up to a scope of 5.
</p>

<p> You should think for a moment about <i>why</i> it is that this
    particular assertion holds.  Once you have thought about it, you
    can look at our <a href="sidenote-acyclic-explanation.html"
    target="sidenote"> intuitive explanation</a>.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> Next we write another assertion and check it, much like the last
    one.  This time, we are checking that there is only one Root
    directory, and that every <b><tt>FSObject</tt></b> is in at most
    one directory.  We use a scope of 5 for both checks.
</p>

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// File system has one root</i><b>
  assert oneRoot {
    one d: Dir | no d.parent
  }

  check oneRoot for 5

  </b><i>// Every fsobject is in at most one directory</i><b>
  assert oneLocation {
    all o: FSObject | lone d: Dir | o in d.contents
  }

  check oneLocation for 5
</pre></b>

<p> Here we encountered the <b><tt>one</b></tt> and
    <b><tt>lone</b></tt> quantifiers for the first time.  The
    <b><tt>one</b></tt> quantifier means "exactly one", and the
    <b><tt>lone</b></tt> quantifier means "zero or one" (you can think
    of it as '<b>l</b>ess than or equal to <b>one</b>).  You may wish
    to read more about these and other <a
    href="sidenote-quantifiers.html" target="sidenote">
    quantifiers</a>.
</p>

<p> We could have written these (or any other assertions) as facts,
    but then they would be redundant (if they hold) or potentially
    masking an important counterexample (if they don't hold).  It is
    always better to check properties rather than redundantly forcing
    them to be true.  If you don't understand why something does (or
    does not) follow from the model, then you don't understand your
    subject matter enough.  One of the benefits of modeling
    (especially declarative modeling) is that it provides a relatively
    painless way to develop such an understanding, along with checking
    things you might otherwise have taken for granted.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> Before proceeding to Lesson II of the File System example, let's
    take a look at the Alloy interface itself.  We will walkthrough
    the basics of how to execute a command to check an Alloy model and
    how to interpret the results.  We will do all of these in the
    context of the first (our current) File System model, focussing on
    checking the two assertions we made.
