    <h2>Alternatives to "one" and appended facts</h2>

In <i>File System Lesson 1</i>, we wrote

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// There exists a root</i><b>
  one sig Root extends Dir { } { no parent }
</b></pre>

Equivalently, we could have accomplished the same effect by writing
two additional facts:

<pre>
  <b>sig Root extends Dir { }
  fact { one Root }
  fact { no Root.parent }</b>
</b></pre>

<p> We could also combine those two <tt><b>fact</b></tt> statements
    into one.  Notice that when more than one constraint appears in a
    fact, they are automatically conjoined together as if you used the &amp;&amp; operator.

<pre>
  <b>sig Root extends Dir { }
  fact {
    one Root
    no Root.parent
  }</b>
</pre>

<p> We could also reword the second constraint in the fact (although
    there is no particular reason to do so) as follows:

<pre>
  <b>sig Root extends Dir { }
  fact {
    one Root
    all r:Root | no r.parent
  }</b>
</pre>

<p> this rewriting works because "<b><tt>.</tt></b>" gets mapped onto
    the elements of a set it is applies to.

<p> Both of these syntatic shorthands can make a model more concise
    and clearer, but are not always appropriate.  When and how you use
    them is a matter of style.
