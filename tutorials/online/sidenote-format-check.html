    <h2>Syntax for <i>check</i> statements</h2>

<p> With Alloy, you can automatically verify (up to a specified scope)
    or falsify (with a counterexample) an <a
    href="sidenote-format-assert.html"><b><tt>assert</b></tt> statement</a>,
    by using a <b><tt>check</b></tt> command.

<b><pre>
  check name-of-assert for integer
</pre></b>

<p> The integer defines the scope -- the maximum size of each set in
    the model that will be considered.  Specifically, it is the
    maximum size of the top-level signatures (sets).  If there is any
    solution in that scope or less, Alloy is guaranteed to find
    it. Thus, we say Alloy is 'complete up to scope'.

<p> For example, the statement

<b><pre>
  check acyclic for 5
</pre></b>

<p> checks the <b><tt>acyclic</tt></b> assertion, and tells Alloy to
    only examine cases where there are at most 5 top level sigs/sets.

<p> Larger scopes take longer to solve, and often result in more
    complicated examples.  Thus it is good practice to reduce the
    scope as low as it can go but still get a solution, before trying
    to visualize solutions.

<p> You can refine you definition of scope with the
    <b><tt>but</tt></b> keyword.  For example:

<b><pre>
  check acyclic for 5 but 1 fileSystem, 7 FSObject
</pre></b>

<p> The <b><tt>but</tt></b> command lets you specify exceptions to the
    main scope.  In this case, Alloy will only examine 1 file system,
    up to 7 file system objects, and up to 5 of any other set.
