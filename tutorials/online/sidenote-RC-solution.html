    <h2><i>River Crossing Puzzle</i>: Solution</h2>

<p> One solution starts out with the farmer bringing the chicken across and then
    return empty handed. The farmer then brings the bag of grain to the far side, but
    bringing the chicken back on the return trip. The farmer then brings the fox to the far side
    and return empty handed. Finally, the farmer brings the chicken across the river again,
    thus fulfilling the goal.</p>

<p> There is one other solution: once again the farmer starts by bringing the chicken across and then
    return empty handed. The farmer then brings the fox to the far side, but
    bringing the chicken back on the return trip. The farmer then brings the bag of grain to the far side
    and return empty handed. Finally, the farmer brings the chicken across the river again,
    thus fulfilling the goal.</p>
