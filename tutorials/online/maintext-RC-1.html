<p> In this tutorial, we will be modelling and finding a solution to
    the <a href="sidenote-RC-puzzle.html" target="sidenote"> Farmer
    River Crossing Puzzle</a>:

<p> A farmer is on one shore of a river and has with him a <b>fox</b>,
    a <b>chicken</b>, and a sack of <b>grain</b>. He has a boat that
    fits one object besides himself.  In the presense of the farmer
    nothing gets eaten, but if left without the farmer, the fox will
    eat the chicken, and the chicken will eat the grain.  How can the
    farmer get all three possessions across the river safely?

<p> In this chapter, we are not trying to verify a global property of
    a system, nor are we verifying that particular operations fulfill
    their specifications, as in the file system example. Rather, we
    are trying to find a single solution, or trace, of a given state
    machine. The solution to this puzzle will be a sequence of states
    that represent the farmer's trips across the river.  We will look
    for a trace satisfing the puzzle in exactly the same manner we
    would search for a (counter)example satisfying some definition of
    an unsafe or undesirable circumstance.

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p> The model begins with an <b><tt>open</tt></b> statement which
    imposes an ordering on the set of State atoms in the model.
    For now, ignore the <b><tt>open</tt></b> statement.

<p> Next we define a <a href="sidenote-format-sig.html" target="sidenote"> signature</a>
    <b><tt>Object</b></tt>, which represents the set of the Farmer and
    his possessions. We partition the <b><tt>Object</b></tt> set into
    four singleton subsets: <b><tt>Farmer</b></tt>,
    <b><tt>Fox</b></tt>, <b><tt>Chicken</b></tt>, and
    <b><tt>Grain</b></tt>.

<b><pre>
  abstract sig Object { eats: set Object }
  one sig Farmer, Fox, Chicken, Grain extends Object {}
</pre></b>

<p> The fox will eat the chicken if the farmer is not with them, and the chicken will
    eat the grain if the farmer is not with them. We represent this relationship with
    the <b><tt>eats</tt></b> relation from Object to Object, and we constrain the exact
    value of the <b><tt>eats</tt></b> relation using the following fact:</p>

<b><pre>
  fact { eats = Fox->Chicken + Chicken->Grain}
</pre></b>

<p> We then create a signature called <b><tt>State</b></tt>, which
    represents the set of states in our model. In each state, there
    are a certain set of objects on the near side of the river, and a
    certain set on the far side of the river.

<b><pre>
  sig State { near, far: set Object }
</pre></b>

<p> We would now like to say that all the <b><tt>Object</b></tt>s are
    on the near side of the river in the first state. We would also
    like to ask Alloy to find a solution in which all the objects are
    on the far side of the river in the last state. The problem is we
    do not yet have a way of talking about the first state, the last
    state, or the fact that one may come before or after another. In
    sum, we need a way to construct a linear ordering of states and
    refer to properties of that ordering. Luckily, Alloy comes with a
    polymorphic linear ordering module that can do that work for
    us. We <a href="sidenote-combining-modules.html"
    target="sidenote"> import this module</a> by adding the following
    line to the beginning of our model.  We parametarize on
    <b><tt>State</tt></b>, so now we can call order comparison
    operations on elements of the <b><tt>State</tt></b> signature.
</p>

<b><pre>
   open util/ordering[State]
</pre></b>

<p> The util/ordering module imposes a total ordering on the atoms of State, and
    provides a few useful functions you can use, including <b><tt>first</tt></b>,
    <b><tt>next</tt></b>, and <b><tt>last</tt></b>.</p>

<blockquote>
 <b><tt>first</tt></b> returns the first State atom in the linear ordering.<br>
 <b><tt>last</tt></b> returns the last State atom in the linear ordering.<br>
 <b><tt>next</tt></b> maps each State atom (except the last atom) to the next State atom.
</blockquote>

<p> Now that we've loaded util/ordering,
    this is how we can use the <b><tt>util/ordering</b></tt> module to say all
    the <b><tt>Object</b></tt>s are on the near side of the river and
    none are on the far side in the initial state:
</p>

<b><pre>
   fact { first.near = Object && no first.far }
</pre></b>

<p> If you're thinking about this problem in terms of a state machine,
    this fact constrained the starting state of the state machine. Now
    let's describe a transition function between states.
</p>

<p> At any state, we will call the side of the river the farmer is
    currently on the '<b><tt>from</b></tt>' side and the other side
    the '<b><tt>to</b></tt>' side. So our function will stipulate how
    the set of objects on the '<b><tt>from</b></tt>' and
    '<b><tt>to</b></tt>' sides change from state to state. Thus, we
    have the following signature for our transition function:
</p>

<b><pre>
   pred crossRiver [from, from', to, to': set Object] { . . . }
</pre></b>

<p> Here is one way we might write this predicate: </p>

<b><pre>
   pred crossRiver [from, from', to, to': set Object] {
     one x: from | {
       from' = from - x - Farmer - from'.eats
       to' = to + x + Farmer
     }
   }
</pre></b>

<p> We know the farmer can take at most one object with him
    across the river. We use "one x: from" to pick exactly one item from the <b><tt>from</tt></b> set.
    There are two possibilities here:</p>

<p>
    If x is not Farmer, then the predicate says that both the Farmer and x travel from <b><tt>from</tt></b>
    to <b><tt>to</tt></b>, and if there were objects that would eat each other when left alone
    then the eating happens.
</p>

<p> If x is Farmer, then the predicate says the Farmer travels alone from <b><tt>from</tt></b>
    to <b><tt>to</tt></b>, and if there were objects that would eat each other when left alone
    then the eating happens.
</p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p> Next we must constrain each consecutive pair of States to
    abide by the transition function. If the farmer is on the near
    side of the river, then the near side of the river is the 'from'
    side and the far side of the river is the 'to' side. And if the
    farmer is on the far side, then the far side is 'from' and the
    near side 'to'. We express this constraint in the following Alloy
    fact.
</p>

<b><pre>
   fact {
     all s: State, s': s.next {
       Farmer in s.near =>
         crossRiver [s.near, s'.near, s.far, s'.far]
       else
         crossRiver [s.far, s'.far, s.near, s'.near]
     }
   }
</pre></b>

<p> The function <b><tt>next</b></tt> in the above fact is provided
    by the <b><tt>util/ordering</b></tt> module. It returns the state that
    follows its argument in the linear ordering. That is,
    <b><tt>s.next</b></tt> returns the state immediately following
    <b><tt>s</b></tt>; unless <b><tt>s</b></tt> is the last state in
    the linear order, in which case it returns the empty set. So the
    quantifying expression "<b><tt>all s: State, s': s.next</b></tt>"
    effectively says "for all consecutive pairs
    of states". It is equivalent to writing "<b><tt>all s, s': State |
    s' = s.next => ...</b></tt>".
</p>

<p> Here we see <b><tt>=></b></tt> followed by two expressions
    (separated by the <b><tt>else</tt></b> keyword) used to denote a conditional (if-then-else)
    <a href="sidenote-logic-ops.html" target="sidenote"> logical
    operation</a>.
</p>

<p> Now that our state machine is defined, we must ask Alloy to
    produce a trace of the state machine in which all the objects are
    on the far side of the river in the final state. To do so, we ask
    Alloy to find a solution where at the last State, we see every Object is at the far side:
</p>

<b><pre>
   run { last.far = Object }
</pre></b>

<p> Recall that <b><tt>Object</b></tt> is just a set and can be read
    as "the set of all Objects".  That is, we are saying that, in the
    last State, the set of things on the far shore equals the set of
    all things.  This is a place where the rough OO level
    understanding of Alloy will mislead you (that is, thinking of
    <b><tt>Object</b></tt> as a class), and a set theoric level of
    understanding is required to make sense of the model.  (Recall our
    earlier discussion of <a
    href="sidenote-levels-of-understanding.html"
    target="sidenote">three levels of abstractness</a> for
    interpreting an Alloy model</a>.)
</p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p> Without specifying a scope, Alloy will assume there are 3 atoms of everything unless
    specified otherwise. In this case, Alloy will assume there are 3 State atoms.
    But Alloy Analyzer knows that there are exactly 4 Objects since it is already defined
    to be the union of 4 singleton disjoint atoms Farmer, Chicken, Fox, and Grain.

<p> Not surprisingly, Alloy finds no solutions, because the problem
    can't be solved in only three states. If we steadily increase the
    scope on the set of States, we eventually reach a point at which
    Alloy can find a solution at a scope of 8. Thus, the command that
    finds the smallest solution to this puzzle is
</p>

<b><pre>
   run { last.far = Object } for exactly 8 State
</pre></b>
