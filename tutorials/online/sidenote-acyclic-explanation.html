    <h2>Why <b><tt>acyclic</b></tt> holds</h2>

<p> Imagine starting at <b><tt>Root</b></tt> and following the
    <b><tt>contents</b></tt> relation.  Suppose you found a cyclic
    path and followed it.  At some point, you will encounter a
    directory which you have already visited.
<ul>
<li> The duplicated directory cannot be the root, since the root has
     no parent (and we have constrained the contents and parent
     relations to be reciprocal).</li>
<li> The duplicated directory cannot be a non-root directory, say
     <b>d</b>, since that would mean that <b>d</b> has two parents
     (but that cannot be the case since the parent relation maps to
     single directory, not a set of directories).</li>
</ul>
<p> Thus a cycle cannot exist.</p>
