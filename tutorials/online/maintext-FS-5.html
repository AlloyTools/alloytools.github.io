<p> In this lesson, we do not add any new features to the model, but
    instead we rewrite part of it to show you a different way to doing
    things.  The resulting model is semantically equivalent, but is a
    bit more concise and arguably clearer.

<p> Two of the four constraints which were in the
    <b><tt>FileSystem</b></tt> appended fact have been removed:

<b><pre>
  no root.parent
  contents in live->live
</pre></b>

<p> These constraints have been built into the other ones.  First of
    all, the line which used to read

<b><pre>
  root: Dir,
</pre></b>

<p> now reads

<b><pre>
  root: Dir & live,
</pre></b>

<p> This defines the root of a FileSystem to be in the set of
    <b><tt>live</b></tt> objects of its <b><tt>FileSystem</b></tt>, and not
    just be any old directory.  (since it is in the <a
    href="sidenote-set-ops.html" target="sidenote"> intersection</a>
    of <b><tt>Dir</b></tt> and <b><tt>live</b></tt>).

<p> Secondly, the lines which use to read

<b><pre>
  parent: FSObject ->lone Dir,
  contents: Dir lone-> FSObject
</pre></b>

<p> now read

<b><pre>
  parent: (live - root) ->one (Dir & live),
  contents: Dir -> FSObject
</pre></b>

<p> This is the same trick, but a little bit messier because it has
    been done to higher arity relations (relations with more than 2
    entries in each row).  The <b><tt>parent</tt></b> relation maps every live object (except the root)
    to exactly one live <b><tt>Dir</tt></b>. The <b><tt>contents</tt></b>
    relation can be relaxed to just say it
    maps from <b><tt>Dir</tt></b> to <b><tt>FSObject</tt></b>
    (since later we have <nobr><b><tt>"contents = ~parent"</tt></b></nobr>
    so the <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation
    will be exactly correct, and we don't need to write <b><tt>"Dir lone->FSObject"</tt></b> here).</p>

<p> Also notice that the <b><tt>lone</b></tt> <a
    href="sidenote-multiplicity.html" target="sidenote">multiplicity
    markings</a> have been replaced by <b><tt>one</b></tt>'s.  Where a
    <b><tt>lone</b></tt> indicated "0 or 1", a <b><tt>one</b></tt>
    indicates "exactly 1".  Thus the first line makes sure that
    each live non-root object has <b>exactly</b> one parent.</p>

<p> In the next lesson, we add dynamic operations to the model,
    <b><tt>move</tt></b> and <b><tt>remove</tt></b>.
