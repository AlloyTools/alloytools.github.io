    <h2>Relations as Ordered Tuples</h2>

<p> Alloy represents relations as sets of ordered tuples, and it can
    some times be useful to think of them this way.  Intuitively, this
    is just an exhaustive list of every way to legally fill in the
    relation.

<p> A (binary) relation mapping file system objects to their parent
    directories is really a set of ordered pairs.  The first entry in
    each pair is a file system object and the second is its parent
    directory.  In one instance, it's entries might look like this:

<pre>
{< fileA, DirA >,
 < fileB, DirB >,
 < fileC, DirA >}
</pre>

<p> Now consider a relation that maps pairs of nodes in a network to
    their cost.  This relation would be said to have <i>arity 3</i>,
    and its tuples might look like this:

<pre>
{< nodeA, nodeB, 100 >,
 < nodeA, nodeC, 25 >,
 < nodeB, nodeD, 37 >,
 < nodeC, nodeD, 14 >}
</pre>

<p> Of course, if we didn't write sufficient constraints on the model,
    the relaion might have more than one cost per pair:

<pre>
{< nodeA, nodeB, 100 >,
 < nodeA, nodeB, 50 >,
 < nodeA, nodeC, 14 >,
 < nodeC, nodeA, 37 >}
</pre>

<p> Since relations are just sets, you can take intersections, unions,
    set differences, and so on on them, just like any other sets.  For
    instance, you might have a relation <b><tt>roads</tt></b>, which
    is an arity-2 relation on cities, stating which one have roads
    connecting them.  It's tuples might look like this:

<pre>
{< cityA, cityB >
 < cityA, cityC >
 < cityB, cityD >
 < cityC, cityD >}
</pre>

<p> There might be another relation <b><tt>dirtRoads</tt></b> which is
    also a relation on pairs of cities.  We might write the constraint

<b><pre>
  fact physicalWorld {
    </b><i>//dirt roads are roads</i><b>
    dirtRoads in roads

    </b><i>//roads are two-way</i><b>
    roads = ~roads
    dirtRoads = ~dirtRoads
  }
</pre></b>

<p> The <b><tt></tt></b>~ operator reverses a relation by reversing
    the tuples in the relation.  Thus our earlier sample falue for
    <b><tt>roads</tt></b> did not satisfy the
    <b><tt>physicalWorld</tt></b> fact.  It should have been

<pre>
{< cityA, cityB >
 < cityB, cityA >
 < cityA, cityC >
 < cityC, cityA >
 < cityB, cityD >
 < cityD, cityB >
 < cityC, cityD >
 < cityD, cityC >}
</pre>

<p> We also might want to talk about non-dirt roads, by writing
    something like this:

<b><pre>
  all r:(roads - dirtRoads) | r.foo ...
</pre></b>

<p> If <b><tt>dirtRoads</tt></b> were

<pre>
{< cityC, cityD >
 < cityD, cityC >}
</pre>

<p> then <b><tt>(roads - dirtRoads)</tt></b> would have to be

<pre>
{< cityA, cityB >
 < cityB, cityA >
 < cityA, cityC >
 < cityC, cityA >
 < cityB, cityD >
 < cityD, cityB >
</pre>

<p> and <b><tt>r</tt></b> might be any of those tuples.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> You can compose two relations, <b><tt>A</tt></b> and
    <b><tt>B</tt></b>, to create a new relation, <b><tt>A.B</tt></b>.
    Each tuple <b><tt>ab</tt></b> of the new relation is created by
    taking a tuple a from A and a typle b from B where the last entry
    in a matches the first entry in b.  Concatenate the tuples, but
    leave out the matched entry.</p>
