Yes, you can use the mouse to right click on the diagram, then choose "export" to export it as a PNG or PDF file. (For single-button mouse users, you can hold down the Control key then click).

Alternatively, you can click the Dot button on the toolbar to see the textual representation of the diagram; simply <nobr>copy & paste</nobr> the text into a text file, then you can use the dot program in [GraphViz](http://graphviz.org/) to generate PS, EPS, JPEG, GIF, and many other output formats.
