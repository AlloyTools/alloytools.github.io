title:  Tree View
---


As implied by its name, the Tree view displays an instance in a tree. The nodes of the tree may be expanded/collapsed to reveal/hide the values of relations. A relation node (such as that for a signature or a field) is expanded to reveal its tuples, and an atom may be expanded to reveal the value of joining the atom with the fields defined in its corresponding signature.
