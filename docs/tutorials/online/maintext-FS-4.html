    <h2>File System Lesson III</h2>

<p> The model we developed in Lesson 2 still has some problems. For
    instance, the following file system is desperately in need of
    help:</p>

<p>   <IMG SRC="alloy-pic7.png" BORDER=0></p>

<p> The problem with this instance is that the File is
    reachable from the root, but is not considered to be a live object in
    the file system (it is not labeled 'live').  When we wrote</p>

<b><pre>
  live in root.*contents
</b></pre>

<p> we ensured that all live objects in the file system are reachable from
    the root, but failed to guarantee that all objects reachable from
    the root are live.  We should instead have written</p>

<b><pre>
  live = root.*contents
</pre></b>


<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> After this change, the model may still generate erroneous solutions like this one:</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="alloy-pic8.png" BORDER=0></p>

<p> Our previous problem is gone, but now there are stray
    <a href="sidenote-relations-are-ordered-pairs.html"
    target="sidenote"> tuples</a> in the <b><tt>contents</tt></b> and <b><tt>parent</tt></b>
    relations. That is, the <b><tt>contents</b></tt> relation is
    defining relationships between file system objects which are not
    live in this file system.  We can fix this by constraining all the
    tuples in the contents relation to be between objects that are live
    in this file system. Adding the following constraint to the appended
    fact achieves this</p>

<b><pre>
  contents in live->live
</pre></b>

<p> Recall that <a href="sidenote-relations-are-ordered-pairs.html"
    target="sidenote"> an Alloy relation is just a set of tuples</a>
    and also that the "<b><tt>-></b></tt>" operator denotes <a
    href="sidenote-format-arrow.html" target="sidenote"> relational
    product</a>.  Thus <b><tt>live->live</tt></b> is a way of
    saying "a relation from live objects to live objects" or "all the 2-element tuples
    where both elements are live objects".  This constraint says that the
    <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation of a file system only maps
    between <b><tt>live</tt></b> objects of that file system.</p>

<p> The resulting bug-free model is shown in the upper-right frame.
    In the next lesson, we look at a different way to solve these same
    problems.</p>

<p> We can view samples solutions to the model by executing the
    <b><tt>run</tt></b> command. Since this is a <b><tt>run</b></tt>
    command, not a <b><tt>check</tt></b> command, solutions it
    generates are not counterexamples -- no claim has been made so
    there's nothing to disprove! If you execute the
    <b><tt>run</tt></b> command, you will probably get a trivial
    solution such as this one:</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="alloy-pic9.png" BORDER=0>

<p> We can enforce some degree of non-triviality by changing the <b><tt>example</tt></b> predicate:</p>

<b><pre>
  pred example {
    all fs: FileSystem | #fs.live > 2
  }
</pre></b>

<p> Now you'll get something that is pleasantly non-trivial.
    Initially, you will get an ugly mess of lines and nodes. We can
    clean this up by editing the customizations for the display:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, you probably want to ensure you are projecting over the FileSystem sig.
<li>Then you can click on the "contents" field and set "Show as Arcs" to be false.
<li>Finally, you can click on the "Dir" sig, and change it to "blue" "parallelograms".
</ol>

<p> Once you've made these changes, you can save the resulting customization by clickong Theme on the top menu bar (not the toolbar!)
    and click "save theme".  For your convenience, we've created this theme file for you which
    you can download it here: <a href="filesystem.thm" target="new">filesystem.thm</a>.
    Put this file in the same directory as your model.  When you have
    a solution displayed, click Theme on to top menu bar (not the toolbar!) then click "load theme" to load this theme.</p>

<p> Now we may see a nice non-trivial example such as this one: </p>
