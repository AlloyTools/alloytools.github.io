    <h2>Syntax for <i>appended facts</i></h2>

<p> An appended fact is written by placing constraints in curly braces
    immediately after a <tt><b>sig</b></tt> statement.  They can make
    a model clearer by logically grouping related constraints
    together.

<b><pre>
  sig name {
    // fields of the signature
  }{
    // appended fact constraints
  }
</b></pre>

<p> Any field mentioned in the appended fact has an implied "<b><tt>all
    this:name |</b></tt>" at its beginning, and an implied
    "<tt><b>this.</b></tt>" in front of it. Thus:

<b><pre>
  sig Person {
      closeFriends: set Person,
      friends: set Person
  } {
      closeFriends in friends
  }
</pre></b>

<p> is really saying

<b><pre>
  sig Person {
      closeFriends: set Person,
      friends: set Person
  }

  fact {
      all x:Person | x.closeFriends in x.friends
  }
</pre></b>

<p> Consequently, appended fact can be more concise (and thus clearer)
    than the equivalent non-appended <a
    href="sidenote-format-fact.html">fact</a>.
    However, there is also a danger in forgetting that <i>every
    field</i> mentioned in an appended fact is prepended with
    "<b><tt>this.</b></tt>".
