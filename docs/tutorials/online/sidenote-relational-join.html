    <h2>Relational Join</h2>

<p> <b><tt>a.b</tt></b> is the composition of the relations
    <b><tt>a</tt></b> and <b><tt>b</tt></b>.  For each tuple in
    <b><tt>a</tt></b> of the form <tt>(a0, a1, ..., an, X)</tt>, and
    each tuple in <b><tt>b</tt></b> of the form <tt>(X, b1, ...,
    bn)</tt>, the new relation <b><tt>a.b</tt></b> contains a tuple
    <tt>(a0, a1, ..., an, b1, ... bn)</tt>.  Only the last atom in
    tuples of <tt><b>a</b></tt> are matched with the first atom in
    tuples of <tt><b>b</b></tt>.  Note that the
    matched atom is removed from the resulting tuple.
</p>

<p> Due to some clever definitions of Semantics, it can also be used
    to access fields of a signature.  See <a
    href="sidenote-levels-of-understanding.html">levels of understanding</a> for examples of different ways to
    interpret the dot.</p>
