    <h2>Pretending Alloy is Object Oriented ("OO")</h2>

<p> Several clever definitions of Alloy language constructs allow you
    to write models which look like a lot like Java/C++ OO code.  The
    key to getting this to work is the interpretation of signature
    declarations (a "<b><tt>sig</tt></b>" statements) and the
    "<b><tt>.</tt></b>" operator (relational composition).  Signatures
    are technically sets, but they can be thought of as objects in
    the OO paradigm.

<p> Consider the following excerpt.  A signature <b><tt>sig
    S</b></tt>, extending <b><tt>E</b></tt>, has a field
    <b><tt>F</b></tt> of type <b><tt>T</b></tt>. </p>

<p> we write:
<b><pre>
  sig S extends E {
    F:T
  }

  fact {
    all s:S | s.F in X
  }
</pre></b>

<p> The fragment can be interpreted in an Object Oriented sense.

<ul>
<li> <b><tt>S</b></tt> is a class
<li> <b><tt>S</b></tt> extends its superclass <b><tt>E</b></tt>
<li> <b><tt>F</b></tt> is a field of <b><tt>S</b></tt> pointing to a
     <b><tt>T</b></tt>
<li> <b><tt>s</b></tt> is an instance of <b><tt>S</b></tt>
<li> <b><tt>.</b></tt> accesses a field
<li> <b><tt>s.F</b></tt> returns something of type <b><tt>T</b></tt>
</ul>

<p> The OO interpretation can be helpful for understanding a model at
    a glance, but can be dangerous if you don't have any deeper
    understanding.  As you become more familiar with Alloy, you will
    find yourself thinking in <a

    theoretic</a> terms.
